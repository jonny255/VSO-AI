# VSO-AI

Inspired by the concept of Veteran Service Officers to help veterans navigate the process of handling claims, but to create an AI entity that would be more accessible to veterans.

## To-Do List':'

- [ ] Monitor and stay up to date with r/VeteransBenefits
- [ ] Monitor and stay up to date with that one massive book that the VA goes by for quantizing disabilities
- [ ] SaaS will need to have a built in EHR
  - Might also use paperless to scan, organize, and index the veteran blue button medical file.
  - Look into the possibility to auto populate information scanned information/blue button pdf file.
- [ ] VA math
- [ ] DSM-5 for mental/behavior health
- [ ] Some kind of process that could categorize certain symptoms veteran has with other symptoms to identify primary disability and supporting/secondary disabilities.
  - Might use one of those relationship engines that could correlate relationships/links between various objects/blobs, similar to how Maltego works under the hood.
- [ ] VA CFR Title 38 Chapter 1 Part 4 SCHEDULE FOR RATING DISABILITIES
  - Also include all other parts and perhaps chapters as well, as they most likely are valuable resources as well, but not primarily needed for the core mission.



### VA Math:

#### VA disability ratings schedule

#### Equations

int

(dis_a %) * 100 = 00 Gross Rating Percentage (GRP)

100 - GRP = 00 Total Rating Percentage (TRP)


// GRP = Next Rating Percentage (NRP)


(dis_b %) * RAP = NRP     (70% = 70; 100 - 70 = 30 (RAP); dis_b% (10% Tinnitus) = 10; 10 * 30)




dis_a70 = 70 GRP
100 - GRP = 30 Remaining Available Percentage (RAP)
